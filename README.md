# FedRAMP Requests For Comment (RFCs)

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) intends to
engage continuously and iteratively with our stakeholders. This repository will
be used as an ongoing digital meeting place for us to hear your experiences and
perspectives.

All FedRAMP RFCs are open to responses from the public and government, including
representatives from cloud service providers, third party independent assessment
organizations, federal agencies, industry organizations, or individuals with an
interest in cybersecurity and cloud services.

All RFCs will provide alternate methods for providing comments for folks who are
unfamiliar with GitHub or would simply prefer to submit comments in a different
way.

> _44 U.S. Code ยง 3609(a)(6)_ requires FedRAMP to:
>
> "establish and maintain a public comment process for proposed guidance and
> other FedRAMP directives that may have a direct impact on cloud service
> providers and agencies before the issuance of such guidance or other FedRAMP
> directives"

### Open RFCs

_There are no currently open RFCs._

| ID                  | Request for Comment On                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Opened     | Closed     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| [0004](rfc/0004.md) | [Boundary Policy](rfc/0004.md)                                 | This draft policy opens discussion on clarifications for the documentation and assessment of the FedRAMP boundary and the reuse of FedRAMP authorized cloud service offerings by cloud service providers.<br><br>**Outcome:** FedRAMP will release an updated boundary model for comment that incorporates extensive feedback and aligns with the new direction for the program and the changes within government operations. The new model will include highest level definitions and requirements only, with additional clarifications, best practices, and implementation expectations provided as technical assistance.                                                                              | 2025-01-16 | 2025-04-02 |
| [0003](rfc/0003.md) | [Review Initiation Checks (RICs)](rfc/0003.md)                 | These optional checklists will help cloud service providers self-verify the completeness of FedRAMP authorization packages. <br><br>**Outcome:** Commenters had mixed responses to the Review Initiation Checks and generally expressed confusion at this approach. Many commenters requested additional nuance and detail while others highlighted concerns about an excess of detail and others flagged issues with outdated aspects of the checks. FedRAMP will internally revisit and reconsider this approach.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2024-12-26 | 2025-04-02 |
| [0002](rfc/0002.md) | [Proposed Revisions to FedRAMP 3PAO Requirements](rfc/0002.md) | FedRAMP is proposing revisions to six requirements and an appendix for the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) R311 requirements for 3PAOs.<br><br>**Outcome:** Many commenters supported removal of the two-tier certification system and strengthening 3PAO requirements to improve assessment quality, while others expressed concerns about potentially excessive requirements for training and its impact on cost. FedRAMP expects 3PAOs to perform high quality assessments and agrees that 3PAOs must figure out the training and certifications necessary to deliver results. FedRAMP will adjust some recommendations and rely on A2LA to determine the best path forward. | 2024-12-19 | 2025-04-02 |
| [0001](rfc/0001.md) | [A New Commment Process for FedRAMP](rfc/0001.md)              | Extended open discussion period for feedback on the pilot FedRAMP RFC process using GitHub. <br><br>**Outcome:** FedRAMP will continue to use a hybrid public comment approach that includes RFCs posted on GitHub as well as alternative submission forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2024-12-18 | 2025-04-02 |

## How will FedRAMP request comments?

FedRAMP will communicate to the public about open RFCs via its various social
channels, including blogs, email lists, and more. Multiple RFCs may be run
simultaneously by the team, and the
[status of all RFCs can be seen here](https://fedramp.gov/rfcs).

#### **Providing feedback**

There are multiple ways to provide feedback on a full RFC:

- Participate in the Discussion thread in the rfcs repository on GitHub

- Follow the instructions in the RFC to use alternative mechanisms for public
  feedback, such as online forms or email. Note that public submissions via
  email will be shared publicly; email is intended primarily for agency comments
  or situations where GitHub is not available.

It is important that each bit of feedback is _concise_ and _actionable_,
providing enough information to allow the document maintainers to adequately
address the feedback.

### How FedRAMP will participate

The FedRAMP team may interact with the public discussion repository in a limited
manner, similar to a digital town hall, by:

- Requesting clarification or additional information if the content of a comment
  is not clear to the FedRAMP reviewer.

- Acknowledging that comments have been reviewed.

- Responding to requests for clarification from the public when that
  clarification would be relevant to a significant portion of the public.

> FedRAMP will consider only the content of the message when responding, and
> will not prioritize or otherwise consider the individual or organization when
> determining which messages to respond to. A response from FedRAMP is not an
> endorsement and does not represent concurrence with the content.

Each public comment request may have multiple rounds, with comments being
addressed in no smaller than 30-day increments.

The end of the public comment period **does not mean the policy will be
immediately implemented.** Other governance activities and final approval will
be required; when ready for adoption or publication, final policies or documents
will be shared publicly with appropriate implementation activities.

_Currently, only members of the FedRAMP team can initiate the formal RFC
process._

### **Why should I submit RFC feedback?**

FedRAMP stakeholders, including cloud service providers (CSPs), security
professionals, government agencies, and industry experts, may provide public
feedback on these documents for several key reasons.

- Influencing Policy and Framework Development: FedRAMP documents, such as
  updates to security guidelines, assessment frameworks, or requirements,
  directly impact stakeholders. By providing feedback, stakeholders have an
  opportunity to shape the policies to ensure they are practical, effective, and
  aligned with industry standards. This can help ensure that the requirements
  and guidelines are feasible for implementation and improve overall security.

- Addressing Practical Implementation Challenges: Stakeholders who are directly
  involved in the FedRAMP authorization or in the process of securing federal
  cloud use may experience unanticipated practical challenges. Public feedback
  allows these stakeholders to highlight real-world issues, propose solutions,
  and ensure that policies are aligned with technological trends and operational
  realities.

- Advocating for Cost-Effectiveness and Efficiency: Cloud service providers and
  other affected parties are often concerned about the costs and administrative
  burden associated with meeting FedRAMP requirements. Providing feedback allows
  stakeholders to advocate for streamlined processes, suggest more efficient
  frameworks, or raise concerns about requirements that might be too expensive
  or complex.

- Ensuring Transparency and Accountability: Public feedback fosters an open
  dialogue between the government and industry. It promotes transparency and
  ensures that stakeholders are part of the decision-making process. This
  collaboration helps build trust between federal agencies and private sector
  participants and ensures that the government remains accountable for
  considering diverse perspectives.

- Mitigating Security Risks: Security professionals may provide feedback to
  ensure that FedRAMP security guidelines are rigorous enough to mitigate
  evolving cybersecurity threats. Their insights help ensure the government's
  security posture remains up-to-date and effectively protects sensitive data.

- Encouraging Innovation: By participating in the public feedback process,
  stakeholders can propose innovative approaches, highlight emerging
  technologies, and suggest ways to incorporate these into improving FedRAMP.
  This ensures that the program remains adaptive to the fast-paced evolution of
  cloud technologies.

Ultimately, public feedback helps ensure that FedRAMP documents and policies
reflect the needs and expertise of both government and private sector entities,
fostering a more secure, efficient, and collaborative cloud security
environment.
