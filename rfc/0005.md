## Summary

The FedRAMP Minimum Assessment Scope proposes an approach to assessing the
security of federal information handled by cloud services that provide services
to federal agency customers by including all information resources managed by a
cloud service provider and their cloud service offering that:

1. Handle federal information; and/or
2. Likely impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal
   information

Information resources where (1) or (2) do not apply, including most metadata,
should be excluded from FedRAMP assessment.

## Motivation and Rationale

This draft standard updates January’s RFC-0004 Boundary Policy draft based on
public feedback and changes to the operating environment for FedRAMP. Due to
executive branch restrictions on the production of significant guidance and
policy materials, this draft proposes a simplified approach to the assessment of
information resources that should be included in a FedRAMP assessment and
authorization.

The FedRAMP Minimum Assessment Scope will replace the former FedRAMP Boundary
approach with a simple and reasonable test that can be applied by cloud service
providers, third-party assessment organizations, and agency officials. The
Minimum Assessment Scope avoids unnecessary detail or specifics to support
FedRAMP’s ongoing shift from compliance-based decision making and assessment to
security-based decision making and assessment.
