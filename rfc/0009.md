## Summary

This Request for Comments (RFC) presents the draft "Significant Change Notification Technical Assistance" document for public review and feedback. This technical assistance is intended to support Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Third-Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) in understanding and effectively applying the [DRAFT] FedRAMP Significant Change Notification Standard [RFC-0007](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/discussions/19). It provides clarifications, a decision-making framework, and illustrative examples for determining the nature of changes (routine recurring, impact categorization, transformative, or adaptive) to cloud services.

This document is a supporting resource for the [DRAFT] Significant Change Notification Standard and is not intended to be used as a standalone document.

## Motivation

The FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC ยง 3609 (a) (3)) directs GSA to develop technical assistance to support the authorization of cloud services. OMB Memorandum M-24-15 further emphasizes modernizing FedRAMP and leveraging commercial cloud innovations.

The [DRAFT] FedRAMP Significant Change Notification Standard (referenced in RFC-0007) introduces a new framework for how CSPs manage and report changes. To ensure consistent and effective implementation of this Standard, clear and practical guidance is essential. 

This "Significant Change Notification Technical Assistance" document aims to:

Provide Agencies, CSPs, and 3PAOs with the necessary context, examples, and decision-support material to confidently apply the Significant Change Notification Standard.
Reduce ambiguity in interpreting terms like "routine recurring," "adaptive," and "transformative" changes within the context of diverse cloud services.
Promote reasonable, defensible, and documented decision-making by CSPs regarding changes to their services.
Support the overall FedRAMP goals of increasing the speed, effectiveness, and transparency of the authorization process, while ensuring robust security.
Reinforce the principle that this guidance should facilitate informed discussions and not be misconstrued as a rigid compliance checklist.

## Explanation

The full draft technical assistance is approximately 8 pages and is available for review in the following formats:

- [Basic web formatting on fedramp.gov](https://fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/0009)
- [Basic text markdown on GitHub](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/discussions/30)
- PDF file: [rfc-0009-scn-technical-assistance.pdf](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/raw/main/rfc/assets/0009-scn-technical-assistance.pdf)
- Word file: [rfc-0009-scn-technical-assistance.docx](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rfcs/raw/main/rfc/assets/0009-scn-technical-assistance.docx)

## Discussion Requested

This draft technical assistance is open for any public comment. FedRAMP encourages informal comments from any member of the public. The public may submit multiple comments and may respond to other public comments. All comments from the public sent via email will be made public.

- Are the examples provided for each change type (routine, transformative, adaptive) sufficiently illustrative and helpful, despite the caveats about not using them as definitive lists? Are there other common scenarios that would benefit from an example?
- Is the guidance on determining what constitutes a "major component or functionality" for transformative changes clear enough to be consistently applied by reasonable people?
- Does this technical assistance effectively support CSPs in developing reasonable, defensible, and documented justifications for their change categorizations?
- Overall, does this technical assistance effectively achieve its stated aims of reducing ambiguity and supporting consistent application of the Significant Change Notification Standard (RFC-0007)?

The [FedRAMP Rev 5 Continuous Monitoring Working Group](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/working-groups/rev5-monitoring/) will simultaneously host discussions on potential best practices and implementation of Significant Change Notifications based on this technical assistance.
