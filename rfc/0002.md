## Outcome

Many commenters supported removal of the two-tier certification system and
strengthening 3PAO requirements to improve assessment quality, while others
expressed concerns about potentially excessive requirements for training and its
impact on cost. FedRAMP expects 3PAOs to perform high quality assessments and
agrees that 3PAOs must figure out the training and certifications necessary to
deliver results. FedRAMP will adjust some recommendations and rely on A2LA to
determine the best path forward.

## Summary

FedRAMP worked with the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA)
to identify how to best revise FedRAMP’s 3PAO policy based on stakeholder
feedback. This collaboration resulted in proposed revisions to six requirements
including participation in the Baltimore cyber range, requirements for different
roles, and an appendix for training focus areas.

## Motivation

As a part of FedRAMP’s ongoing commitment to improvement and stakeholder
engagement, a 3PAO strategy session was held in FY24 to collaborate on solutions
for addressing current challenges faced by both FedRAMP and FedRAMP-recognized
3PAOs. Specifically, two main challenge areas were discussed:

1. FedRAMP highlighted the persistence of assessment deliverables that did not
   meet FedRAMP performance standards around documentation quality and testing
   accuracy/completeness, which resulted in multiple security package
   resubmissions.

2. The 3PAO participants expressed their concerns regarding the high costs of
   training junior staff, which was inhibiting team growth.

At the conclusion of the session, a consensus was made that the best approach to
address these challenge areas was to revise FedRAMP’s 3PAO requirements around
training and certifications to minimize 3PAO personnel training costs while also
ensuring assessors were sufficiently trained to produce high quality products to
the federal government.

## Discussion Requested

We are asking for feedback to ensure the proposed personnel training and
certification requirement updates will not impose overly burdensome costs on
3PAOs and to gain alignment on the benefit of updating personnel training and
certification requirements to enhance personnel skills needed to perform
successful FedRAMP assessments.
