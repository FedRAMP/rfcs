## FedRAMP Guidance Types

- **Standards** are base requirements that can be applied in any environment and will change rarely
- **Best Practices** support standards with methods, techniques, or examples and may change often
- **Technical Assistance** supports standards with additional technical nuance to support decision making and may change often


## Summary

This Request for Comment (RFC) seeks public input on draft interpretive technical assistance for OMB Memorandum M-24-15, Section 3, "Modernizing the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)." This technical assistance provides additional technical nuance to support agency decision-making regarding the categories of cloud services excluded from FedRAMP requirements. The draft document offers interpretive guidance with illustrative examples for each of the five exclusion categories defined in M-24-15, along with a summary table to aid consistent application across federal agencies.

## Motivation

OMB Memorandum M-24-15 updated FedRAMP's scope and mandated the publication of clarifying guidance to aid agencies in interpreting the defined exclusion categories. Section 3 of M-24-15 states: "FedRAMP, in consultation with OMB, will publish guidelines for interpreting the categories above, with supporting examples that clearly illustrate what types of services are in and out of scope."

This draft technical assistance has been developed to fulfill that requirement by providing the necessary technical nuance to help agencies navigate and make consistent determinations about FedRAMP applicability.

To ensure maximum reusability of this technical assistance across agencies and encourage thoughtful implementation, the guidance provides key criteria that agencies can apply when evaluating cloud services. This approach allows agencies to focus resources on services that genuinely require FedRAMP authorization while avoiding unnecessary burden for services that fall outside the scope of FedRAMP.

## Explanation

The full draft technical assistance is approximately 5 pages and is available for review in the following formats:

## Discussion Requested

FedRAMP is seeking feedback on all aspects of this draft technical guidance. We encourage specific comments on, but not limited to, the following areas:

- Are exclusion explanations clear, concise, and easy for a non-technical reader to understand?
- Are the sections "When FedRAMP Doesnâ€™t Apply" and "Key Tests" accurate and provide practical guidance for making determinations?
- Is the distinction between "Out of Scope" and "In Scope" clearly illustrated with relatable examples for various cloud service models?
- Does the guidance offer sufficient clarity on how to handle hybrid scenarios or situations where only a portion of a service falls under FedRAMP requirements?
- Are there any terms used that could be interpreted differently across agencies, and if so, are definitions or further explanations needed?
- Are there areas involving AI or other emerging technologies that require additional information to inform agency evaluation of FedRAMP scope applicability?
