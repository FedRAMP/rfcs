## Summary

FedRAMP Review Initiation Checks (RICs) provide cloud service providers,
independent assessors, and federal agencies with checklists to ensure an
authorization package is complete and ready for FedRAMP review. These optional
checklists highlight the most frequently misunderstood and/or commonly
incomplete aspects of a package that regularly require rework from a cloud
service provider after initial review by FedRAMP. Following the RICs at the
appropriate time will require additional up front effort by the cloud service
provider and is thus entirely optional, but packages submitted with a completed
set of RICs are far more likely to pass initial review and reduce rework.

## Motivation

Preparing all of the documentation and materials required to complete a FedRAMP
authorization package is a difficult and complex task. Initial reviews by
FedRAMP often uncover common issues that slow down review or require significant
rework and re-review, often months after the package has been submitted to
FedRAMP due to the size of the FedRAMP review backlog.

We anticipate that having an explicit checklist for cloud service providers to
review the completeness and readiness of their package when they have completed
major phases of work will improve the consistency of FedRAMP reviews and reduce
the frequency of re-reviews required. This will increase the speed of
authorization and reduce the overall effort for cloud service providers who
follow the checklists.

These checklists can also inform business decisions on readiness and progress in
a slightly more consumable format that the package documentation itself.

## Explanation

There are two draft checklists available for review and feedback:

## Discussion Requested

These Review Initiation Checks are optional tools for cloud service providers to
reduce the overall burden of preparing packages for FedRAMP authorization. If
the RICs are successful at improving initial package consistency and reducing
re-review, FedRAMP may prioritize cloud service offerings in the backlog based
on use of the RICs by the cloud service provider.

FedRAMP is open to all comments on the proposed RICs but is especially
interested in understanding if they are sufficiently clear and concise for use
or what improvements are necessary to ensure they can be. FedRAMP does not
intend to require use of the RICs and would also like to understand if optional
supporting processes like this are useful to cloud service providers.
