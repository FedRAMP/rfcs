## Where to Comment

Members of the public may submit multiple different comments on different issues during the public comment period. The public is asked to please refrain from including documents or spreadsheets (especially those with in-line comments or suggested changes) in public comment as this creates a significant additional review burden.

Formal public comment for official consideration by FedRAMP can be made via the following mechanisms in order of preference:

1. GitHub Post: [https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/83](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/83)  
2. Public Comment Form: [https://forms.gle/Ry25zn1GUDJXHs5o9](https://forms.gle/Ry25zn1GUDJXHs5o9)  
3. Email: [pete@fedramp.gov](mailto:pete@fedramp.gov) with the subject "**RFC-0014 Feedback**"

Note: FedRAMP will review and publicly post all public comments received via email, but will not otherwise respond. Email submissions from federal agencies will only be made public when requested by the agency.

## Summary & Motivation

FedRAMPs Key Security Indicators summarize the security capabilities expected of a cloud service provider who wishes to obtain and maintain a FedRAMP 20x authorization. These capabilities are broadly summarized with the expectation of broad automated application.

This RFC summarizes proposed changes to the existing Key Security Indicators where they were ineffective, unclear, or insufficient. This RFC also proposes new Key Security Indicators for both FedRAMP Low and FedRAMP Moderate to resolve outstanding gaps and integrate additional controls.

Keen observers will note that there are very few new Key Security Indicators required for Moderate; this is because almost every single Moderate control is already covered by an existing or slightly modified Key Security Indicator. Cloud service providers seeking Moderate authorization during the Phase Two pilot will need to demonstrate _significantly_ approved maturity in both depth and automation related to all Key Security Indicators; simply adopting the new Key Security Indicators will not be sufficient.

During Phase One FedRAMP would accept written attestation that some Key Security Indicators were met for a Low authorization. During Phase Two, FedRAMP will expect truly automated and opinionated validation of Key Security Indicators for a Moderate authorization. For example, KSI-PIY-06 expects validation that a provider has staff and budget for security - FedRAMP accepted attestations about general budget or staffing numbers for Low but will expect to see automated validations demonstrating the participation and involvement of security staff in common operations to prove this validation is met for Moderate.

For this and other Key Security Indicators, FedRAMP plans to publish simple Technical Assistance prior to accepting submissions for Phase Two. In the interim, the FedRAMP Community [20x Pilot Review Feedback Friday](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/69) discussion contains many pro-tips for navigating Key Security Indicators.

## Documentation Guidelines

The following FedRAMP documentation guidelines apply to this document:

* The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).  
* FedRAMP-specific terms defined in [FRD-ALL (FedRAMP Definitions)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/docs/blob/main/markdown/FRMR.FRD.fedramp-definitions.md) are italicized throughout this document for reference.
